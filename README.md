## Technologies used

  - Used for wireframing: To plan for the structure of the website

- [Keyframes](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/shake-css-keyframe-animation/)
  - The project uses keyframes to display animation when a field is not entered in the form. (In my project; shake)

- [Keyframes-webkit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)
  - The animation shorthand is used to let the images slide; as a slideshow.

- [Email validation](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php")
  - The project uses a format that can be used to confirm the correct format for the email.</li>

- [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons)
  - The project uses a database where we can conveniently add any icon of our choice to our website, for decorative purposes.

  1. Click on the "Add to cart" button, adding the products into a local storage
  2. Adjust the number of quantities for that particular addition
  3. The product's quantity should be registered in the shopping cart
